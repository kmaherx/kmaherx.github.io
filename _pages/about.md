I'm interested in computation through population activity.
[Beautiful temporal orchestration of biological neurons](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3643) inspired me to [study neuroscience](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00078.2018) at Cornell.
However, I was discouraged by how hard it was to measure large neuronal populations in such a privileged tissue.
For my PhD at MIT, [I pivoted toward spatial transcriptomics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.14.607982v1.abstract), as it provided measurement of more cells in more accessible tissues.
However, I was again discouraged by the lack of temporal information, as making such measurements necessarily kills the tissue.
I'm now interested in mechanistic interpretability of large-scale models, since they offer both population activity *and* measurability *in silico*.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
