  abstract={Spatial transcriptomics technologies enable unbiased measurement of the cell-cell interactions underlying tissue structure and function. However, most unsupervised methods instead focus on identifying tissue regions, representing them as positively covarying low-frequency spatial patterns of gene expression over the tissue. Here, we extend this frequency-based (i.e. harmonic) approach to show that negatively covarying high frequencies represent interactions. Similarly, combinations of low and high frequencies represent interactions along large length scales, or, equivalently, region boundaries. The resulting equations further reveal a duality in which regions and interactions are complementary representations of the same underlying information, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. We demonstrate these concepts in multiple datasets from human lymph node, human tonsil, and mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. Altogether, this work offers a conceptually consistent quantitative framework for spatial transcriptomics.},

	abstract = {Several computational methods have recently been developed for characterizing molecular tissue regions in spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data. However, each method fundamentally relies on spatially smoothing transcriptomic features across neighboring cells. Here, we demonstrate that smoothing increases autocorrelation between neighboring cells, causing latent space to encode physical adjacency rather than spatial transcriptomic patterns. We find that randomly sub-sampling neighbors before smoothing mitigates autocorrelation, improving the performance of existing methods and further enabling a simpler, more efficient approach that we call spatial integration (SPIN). SPIN leverages the conventional single-cell toolkit, yielding spatial analogies to each tool: clustering identifies molecular tissue regions; differentially expressed gene analysis calculates region marker genes; trajectory inference reveals continuous, molecularly defined ana tomical axes; and integration allows joint analysis across multiple SRT datasets, regardless of tissue morphology, spatial resolution, or experimental technology. We apply SPIN to SRT datasets from mouse and marmoset brains to calculate shared and species-specific region marker genes as well as a molecularly defined neocortical depth axis along which several genes and cell types differ across species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract={Spatially charting molecular cell types at single-cell resolution across the 3D volume is critical for illustrating the molecular basis of brain anatomy and functions. Single-cell RNA sequencing has profiled molecular cell types in the mouse brain, but cannot capture their spatial organization. Here we used an in situ sequencing method, STARmap PLUS, to profile 1,022 genes in 3D at a voxel size of 194 × 194 × 345 nm3, mapping 1.09 million high-quality cells across the adult mouse brain and spinal cord. We developed computational pipelines to segment, cluster and annotate 230 molecular cell types by single-cell gene expression and 106 molecular tissue regions by spatial niche gene expression. Joint analysis of molecular cell types and molecular tissue regions enabled a systematic molecular spatial cell-type nomenclature and identification of tissue architectures that were undefined in established brain anatomy. To create a transcriptome-wide spatial atlas, we integrated STARmap PLUS measurements with a published single-cell RNA-sequencing atlas, imputing single-cell expression profiles of 11,844 genes. Finally, we delineated viral tropisms of a brain-wide transgene delivery tool, AAV-PHP.eB. Together, this annotated dataset provides a single-cell resource that integrates the molecular spatial atlas, brain anatomy and the accessibility to genetic manipulation of the mammalian central nervous system.},
