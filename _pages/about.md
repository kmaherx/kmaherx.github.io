[The temporal geometry of neuronal populations](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3643) inspired me to [study neuroscience](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00078.2018) in college.
However, only a small fraction of neurons in the brain can be measured at the same time due to technological and physiological limitations.

For my PhD, I pivoted toward [spatial geometry of cells using spatial transcriptomics](assets/pdf/harmonics.pdf), as it provides measurements of more cells in more accessible tissues.
However, it lacks temporal information because such measurements necessarily kill the tissue.

Ultimately, this path has led me to an interest in ML/AI -- particularly in [mechanistic interpretability](https://www.anthropic.com/research#interpretability) of artificial neural networks.
[Not only can these models be trained to capture interesting biology -- they provide *both* interesting geometry *and* full measurability in silico](https://www.markov.bio/research/mech-interp-path-to-e2e-biology).

*My goal is to leverage my background in computation and biology to train and interpret such models.*
*[This blog](/blog) will chronicle my steps toward it.*
