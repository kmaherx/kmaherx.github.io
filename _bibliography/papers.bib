  abstract={Spatial transcriptomics technologies enable unbiased measurement of the cell-cell interactions underlying tissue structure and function. However, most unsupervised methods instead focus on identifying tissue regions, representing them as positively covarying low-frequency spatial patterns of gene expression over the tissue. Here, we extend this frequency-based (i.e. harmonic) approach to show that negatively covarying high frequencies represent interactions. Similarly, combinations of low and high frequencies represent interactions along large length scales, or, equivalently, region boundaries. The resulting equations further reveal a duality in which regions and interactions are complementary representations of the same underlying information, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. We demonstrate these concepts in multiple datasets from human lymph node, human tonsil, and mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. Altogether, this work offers a conceptually consistent quantitative framework for spatial transcriptomics.},

  abstract={Spatially charting molecular cell types at single-cell resolution across the 3D volume is critical for illustrating the molecular basis of brain anatomy and functions. Single-cell RNA sequencing has profiled molecular cell types in the mouse brain, but cannot capture their spatial organization. Here we used an in situ sequencing method, STARmap PLUS, to profile 1,022 genes in 3D at a voxel size of 194 × 194 × 345 nm3, mapping 1.09 million high-quality cells across the adult mouse brain and spinal cord. We developed computational pipelines to segment, cluster and annotate 230 molecular cell types by single-cell gene expression and 106 molecular tissue regions by spatial niche gene expression. Joint analysis of molecular cell types and molecular tissue regions enabled a systematic molecular spatial cell-type nomenclature and identification of tissue architectures that were undefined in established brain anatomy. To create a transcriptome-wide spatial atlas, we integrated STARmap PLUS measurements with a published single-cell RNA-sequencing atlas, imputing single-cell expression profiles of 11,844 genes. Finally, we delineated viral tropisms of a brain-wide transgene delivery tool, AAV-PHP.eB. Together, this annotated dataset provides a single-cell resource that integrates the molecular spatial atlas, brain anatomy and the accessibility to genetic manipulation of the mammalian central nervous system.},

  abstract={Cholinergic inputs to cortex modulate plasticity and sensory processing, yet little is known about their role in motor control. Here, we show that cholinergic signaling in a songbird vocal motor cortical area, the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), is required for song learning. Reverse microdialysis of nicotinic and muscarinic receptor antagonists into RA in juvenile birds did not significantly affect syllable timing or acoustic structure during vocal babbling. However, chronic blockade over weeks reduced singing quantity and impaired learning, resulting in an impoverished song with excess variability, abnormal acoustic features, and reduced similarity to tutor song. The demonstration that cholinergic signaling in a motor cortical area is required for song learning motivates the songbird as a tractable model system to identify roles of the basal forebrain cholinergic system in motor control.},
