Recall that low-pass filtering corresponds to multiplying our data matrix by a function of the graph Laplacian matrix. Let’s resume this thought by defining our variables so we are all roughly on the same page.</p> <p>Our gene expression is given by the cell-by-gene matrix</p> \[\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{c \times g},\] <p>where $c$ is the number of cells and $g$ is the number of genes.</p> <p>One might think that performing conventional single-cell analysis on low-pass filtered data would identify large-scale transcriptional features over the tissue (as opposed to cell type features). In this section, we will show that this is indeed the case.</p> <p>First, we can visualize the result of performing low-pass filtering on a given gene expression signal over the tissue. Consider a marker gene for one of the inner regions of our tissue. Drag the slider left to right to compare the signal before and after filtering.</p> <style>.slider-with-shadows{--default-handle-shadow:0 0 5px rgba(0,0,0,1);--divider-shadow:0 0 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)}</style> <div style="width: 50%; max-width: 768px; margin: 0 auto;"> <img-comparison-slider class="slider-with-shadows"> <figure slot="first"> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/figures/regions/unfiltered_signal-480.webp 480w,/assets/figures/regions/unfiltered_signal-800.webp 800w,/assets/figures/regions/unfiltered_signal-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/figures/regions/unfiltered_signal.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure slot="second"> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/figures/regions/lowpass_signal-480.webp 480w,/assets/figures/regions/lowpass_signal-800.webp 800w,/assets/figures/regions/lowpass_signal-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/figures/regions/lowpass_signal.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </img-comparison-slider> </div> <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> [Interactive] Comparison of a gene expression signal before (left) and after (right) filtering. </figcaption> <p>Note that the small-scale variation in expression has been washed away. Neighboring cells are forced to look more similar to one another, in effect isolating only <em>large</em>-scale patterns.</p> <h3 id="gene-gene-relationships">Gene-gene relationships</h3> <p>Now that we’ve isolated large-scale gene expression patterns, we can start to compare them to find interesting gene-gene relationships. Intuitively, a group of expression patterns that overlap should represent a region. We can find these groups by looking at pairwise relationships between genes, namely via covariance.</p> <p>Let $\mathbf{\bar X} = [\mathbf{\bar x_1} | … | \mathbf{\bar x_g}] \in \mathbb{R}^{c \times g}$ represent the cell-by-gene matrix of low-pass filtered gene signals. The relationships between all pairs of genes can be represented in terms of covariance. Assuming mean centering, this “low-pass covariance matrix” is given by</p> \[\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{\bar X}^{\top} \mathbf{\bar X} \in \mathbb{R}^{g \times g},\] <p>with entry $\mathbf{C}_{ij} = \mathbf{x_i}^{\top} \mathbf{x_j}$ being the similarity between genes $i$ and $j$. We drop the bar notation for simplicity going forward. Note that, for quantitative simplicity, we do not perform mean centering and find that it rarely impacts the results.</p> <p>We can visualize $\mathbf{C}$ as an image. Gene markers for each region form red blocks along the diagonal, denoting positively covarying groups of genes, i.e. gene programs. Gene programs describing different regions can be seen to negatively correlate, forming blue blocks along the off-diagonal.</p> <p>Ultimately, we seek to distill these patterns of complementary gene programs into a simpler representation – perhaps by assigning each gene a single value. Let $\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{R}^{c}$ represent this desired representation. If $\mathbf{u}$ is a good representation, it should produce a similar covariance pattern to $\mathbf{C}$. This can be quantified as</p> \[\sum_{ij} \mathbf{C}_{ij} (\mathbf{u}_i \mathbf{u}_j).\] <p>Thus, we wish to find the embedding $\mathbf{u}$ that maximizes this expression.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="gradients">Gradients</h2> <p>The above components indeed appear to contain orthogonal information. They each describe unique sets of regions. Together, however, these features can describe more complex region patterns. Rather than projecting cells onto a single component, one can instead project onto multiple components that form a multidimensional “region space”. For instance, we can project cells onto the space defined by the top three components by calculating</p> \[\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{U} \in \mathbb{R}^{c \times 3}\] <p>where $\mathbf{U} = [\mathbf{u}_1 | \mathbf{u}_2 | \mathbf{u}_3]$. Cells can then be plotted in the resulting three-dimensional space Figure.</p> <p>Note that the cells appear to form a one-dimensional manifold. In order to interpret this manifold, one can first fit a line to it and visualize it in tissue space. To fit a line, we first connect neighboring cells in this region space using a weighted Delaunay triangulation. Cells closer to one another have higher weights while those further from one another have lower weights. This provides a \textit{domain} in region space. We can then calculate and eigendecompose the corresponding Laplacian matrix to find the lowest eigenvector which represents the lowest frequency and thus the longest path through the domain. The result is the coloring shown in Figure. Note that this approach is essentially the same as diffusion maps, which is a conventional single-cell trajectory inference method.</p> <iframe src="/assets/plotly/region_gradient.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="yes" height="500px" width="100%" style="border: none; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe> <p>The resulting coloring reveals a continuous, molecularly defined “depth” axis, as seen when plotted in the tissue. We could alternatively make sense of this manifold given the components plotted in. Component 1 describes an “inside-outside” pattern with only the outermost layer considered outside. Component 2 then splits the inside layers from component 1 in the same way. Finally, component 3 further splits the inside layers from component 2. Thus, together, these features can distinguish each layer, while the inside-outside patterns enable the layers to be related to one another in terms of depth.</p> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/assets/figures/regions/region_gradient.png" alt="" style="width:50%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/> <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Molecular gradient visualized in the tissue.</figcaption> </figure> <hr/> <h2 id="clusters">Clusters</h2> <p>Nice.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kamal Maher</name></author><category term="spatial-omics"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A principled approach to representing multicellular regions in spatial omics data]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Spatial Omics I: Transcriptional Signals Over Tissue Domains</title><link href="https://kmaherx.github.io/blog/2025/graph-fourier/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Spatial Omics I: Transcriptional Signals Over Tissue Domains"/><published>2025-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://kmaherx.github.io/blog/2025/graph-fourier</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kmaherx.github.io/blog/2025/graph-fourier/"><![CDATA[<style>.slider-with-shadows{--default-handle-shadow:0 0 5px rgba(0,0,0,1);--divider-shadow:0 0 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)}</style> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Here, we will build an intuition for how to describe frequencies over graphs in terms of gene expression over biological tissues.

Such “types” catalogued by efforts such as the human cell atlas.</p> <p>But cells don’t act independently. If you look at an organism, you’ll notice a few things. First, it’s an organism; there’s some sense that it’s a discrete collection of cells all working together. Second, you might notice that cells within a given organism are further organized into discrete multicellular structures, such as organs or the anatomical regions within them. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the very formation and function of such structures is driven by interactions between their constituent cells. Altogether, it is critical to look beyond cells in isolation to recognize their</p> <p>We can break these patterns down into two broad categories. Multicellular regions Intercellular interactions</p> <p>Both of these patterns are inherently spatial. Regions Interactions Thus, spatial omics technologies enable us to measure these patterns.</p> <p>Given the importance of this data, we should have a concrete way to quantitatively describe and analyze them. However, the current landscape of computational methods for spatial omics data is deeply fragmented. It largely consists of complicated methods based on graph neural networks and probabilistic models, and it lacks a fundamental basis for relating these approaches or even defining the core features one would like to quantify.</p> <p>In this series of posts, we will derive such a basis. The tools we will use are borrowed from the vast field of signal processing.</p> <h3 id="domains-and-signals">Domains and signals</h3> <p>Sound (Continuous, 1D)</p> <p>Images (discrete, 2D)</p> <p>Graphs?

This will allow us to build up some intuition before approaching data gathered from real tissues, which is full of both technical artifacts and true biological complexity.</p> <h3 id="construction">Construction</h3> <p>Take the brain as inspiration. We’ll start off by creating a simple tissue made up of $n=2000$ cells randomly scattered throughout a unit circle. One should ask why a circle and not a sphere. It’s because, while tissues are 3D objects, we tend to measure them in 2D slices. That being said, everything presented in this series of posts can be generalized to data in arbitrary dimensions, including 3D.</p> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/assets/figures/fourier/tissue_domain_nozoom.png" alt="" style="width:30%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/> <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Simulation of a simple, circular tissue. </figcaption> </figure> <p>Some spatial cells that form layers (neurons), some non-spatial cells scattered throughout (glia, for the most part).</p> <p>Ground truth region patterns.

For instance, two <em>neighboring</em> cells might interact when <em>one</em> expresses a ligand and <em>the other</em> expresses the corresponding receptor. This would produce a mutually exclusive pattern between two genes: one associated with the ligand and the other associated with the receptor. We can simulate this by</p> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/assets/figures/fourier/simulation_highs.png" alt="" style="width:100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/> <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Schematic for simulating intercellular interaction patterns. </figcaption> </figure> <p>Note that this simulation is not nearly as complex as a real biological tissue or the data measured from one. That being said, it should at least provide a simple playground in which we can explore some fundamental quantitative concepts that we will later apply to real data.</p> <h3 id="the-tissue-domain">The tissue domain</h3> <p>Just as in music or images, tissues can be thought of in terms of signal processing. Namely, that can be broken down into gene expression signals over a “tissue domain”. However, this tissue domain isn’t continuous like time, as it’s composed of discrete cells. We might instead compare it to an image in which each pixel is akin to a cell. However, cells are not arranged neatly into perfect grids like pixels are. Thus, we need a different structure to represent our tissue.</p> <p>We can think of such a tissue domain as an undirected graph over $n$ nodes, each of which represents a cell. We could construct this graph in many ways, including connecting each cell to its k nearest physical neighbors. Personally, I prefer using a Delaunay triangulation, as it creates a mesh that’s embeddable in 2D, which respects my own visual intuition. If you’re optimistic, you might also believe that it <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20082148/">captures the mechanical forces present in biological tissues</a>. After performing a Delaunay triangulation, we can zoom in to see that the cells are indeed connected to their spatial neighbors to form a 2D mesh. These connections define the space within which we can hop from cell to cell.</p> <figure style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/assets/figures/fourier/tissue_domain.png" alt="" style="width:50%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/> <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Cells arranged in a spatial graph to form a tissue domain. </figcaption> </figure> <p>Now let’s define the key mathematical objects associated with this tissue domain. Our graph can be represented by the symmetric adjacency matrix</p> \[\mathbf{A} \in \{0,1\}^{n \times n}.\] <p>Each entry \(\mathbf{A}_{ij}\) is either $1$, which represents two cells that are spatially adjacent, or $0$, which represents two cells that are not adjacent. While we could weight these edges based on physical distances between cells, we will instead stick to simple binary edges for simplicity. We also will not consider self loops: \(\mathbf{A}_{ii} = 0\). The number of neighbors for cell $i$ – the “degree” – is given by \(d_i = \sum_j \mathbf{A}_{ij}\). These values are often consolidated into the diagonal degree matrix</p> \[% \mathbf{D} = \operatorname{diag}(d_1, ..., d_n) = \mathbf{D} = \begin{bmatrix} d_{1} &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; \ddots &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; d_{n} \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}.\] <p>Now that we have a tissue domain, we can begin to</p> <h3 id="transcriptional-signals">Transcriptional signals</h3> <p>A signal is a value associated with each node in our graph. For instance, we could consider the amount that a given gene is expressed in each cell within a tissue. Spatial transcriptomics provides exactly this type of information, typically for hundreds of different genes.</p> <p>Before discussing transcriptional signals in mathematical detail, let’s first gain some intuition from biology for what they look like and then add some to our simulation. In real tissues, they might vary in their spatial scale, some looking like a region and some looking noisy.
