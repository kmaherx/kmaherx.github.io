[The beautiful temporal orchestration of biological neurons](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3643) inspired me to [study neuroscience](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00078.2018) at Cornell.
However, I was discouraged by how hard it was to measure large neuronal populations in such a privileged tissue.

For my PhD at MIT, [I pivoted toward spatial transcriptomics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.14.607982v1.abstract), as it provided measurements of more cells in more accessible tissues.
However, I was discouraged by the lack of temporal information, as making such measurements necessarily kills the tissue.

This path has led me to an interest in [mechanistic interpretability](https://www.anthropic.com/research#interpretability) of artificial neural networks.
[Not only can these models be trained to capture interesting biology -- they also offer both interesting population activity *and* in silico measurability](https://www.markov.bio/research/mech-interp-path-to-e2e-biology).
My goal is to leverage my background in computation and biology to train and interpret such models.
