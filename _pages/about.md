[The population geometry of biological neurons](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3643) inspired me to [study neuroscience](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00078.2018) in college.
However, only a small fraction of the neurons in the brain were measurable due to technological and clinical limitations.

For my PhD, I pivoted toward [spatial geometry of cells using spatial transcriptomics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.14.607982v1.abstract), as it provided measurements of more cells in more accessible tissues.
However, it lacked temporal information, as making such measurements necessarily kills the tissue.

This path has led me to an interest in [mechanistic interpretability](https://www.anthropic.com/research#interpretability) of artificial neural networks.
[Not only can these models be trained to capture interesting biology -- they also provide *both* interesting population geometry *and* full measurability in silico](https://www.markov.bio/research/mech-interp-path-to-e2e-biology).

My goal is to leverage my background in computation and biology to train and interpret such models.
This blog will chronicle my adventures toward achieving my goal.
