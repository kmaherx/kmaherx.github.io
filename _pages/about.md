[The beautiful temporal orchestration of biological neurons](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3643) inspired me to [study neuroscience](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00078.2018) at Cornell.
However, I was discouraged by how hard it was to measure large neuronal populations in such a privileged tissue.

For my PhD at MIT, [I pivoted toward spatial transcriptomics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.14.607982v1.abstract), as it provided measurements of more cells in more accessible tissues.
However, I was discouraged by the lack of temporal information, as making such measurements necessarily kills the tissue.

I'm now interested in mechanistic interpretability of artificial neural networks, as they offer both interesting population activity *and* in silico measurability.
